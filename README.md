Three js stuff. Learning how to build a portfolio using this. Teehee.

It is split into a few different branches. I am trying to learn how to setup a scene right. And slowly start to get the features and interactions that i want it to do. So when i click on a object with a raycaster. It will swap to a different camera angle. 

The differnt branches show differnt ideas and thoughts as i progress through this.

Ill slowly push my more complete things to the main branch, But for now. The ones that have the recent pushes are what im working on and figuring out.

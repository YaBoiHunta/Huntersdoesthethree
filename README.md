Three js stuff. Learning how to build a portfolio using this. Teehee.

Trying to build a skateboard shop looking 3D scene. Since thats what im intersted in. And then maybe i can have my skateboards explain the other projects or work ive done on things. 

Just a idea, but im chipping away at it bit by bit.

This branch will be a moveable skateboard that the user can move around the plane as if it were a skateboard park.

Trying to build a skateboard shop looking 3D scene. Since thats what im intersted in. And then maybe i can have my skateboards explain the other projects or work ive done on things. 

Just a idea, but im chipping away at it bit by bit.

It is split into a few different branches. I am trying to learn how to setup a scene right. And slowly start to get the features and interactions that i want it to do. So when i click on a object with a raycaster. It will swap to a different camera angle. 

The differnt branches show differnt ideas and thoughts as i progress through this.

Ill slowly push my more complete things to the main branch, But for now. The ones that have the recent pushes are what im working on and figuring out. 

1/9 Okay i got the fundamentals down for what i want this project to be. Here is a rough draft.
